# poverty-mapping-transfer-learning
This repository contains the scripts for my efforts to replicate and improvise the research on poverty mapping through satellite imagery. This is largely inspired from 'Transfer Learning from Deep Features for Remote Sensing and Poverty Mapping' by Michael Xie, Neal Jean, Marshall Burke, David Lobell, Stefano Ermon
